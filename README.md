# Reversi for QL SuperForth #
This is an implementation of the game Reversi written for SuperForth running on the Sinclair QL (see [QL-SuperForth](https://github.com/gerryjackson/QL-SuperForth). It was originally written in 1985/6, in rather a hurry, to test SuperForth and to demonstrate SuperForth's capabilities. SuperForth was marketed by a company called Digital Precision, now defunct, which decided to include Reversi with the SuperForth package complete with a listing of the source code in the manual. SuperForth implements the Forth 83 standard.

There is continuing interest in the Sinclair QL and software running on the QL and following requests from enthusiasts both SuperForth and QL Reversi have been placed in GitHub repositories.

The executable included with SuperForth seems to have been version 1.7 whereas the listing in the SuperForth manual is version 1.2. The listing is heavily commented to enable a good understanding of how the program works. Thirty years on the only Reversi source code available is version 1.8 and that is included here. V1.8 has hardly any comments (the reason for this is lost in the mists of time!) but is clearly derived from v1.2 and v1.7 and so the [SuperForth manual](https://github.com/gerryjackson/QL-SuperForth/tree/master/doc/ superforth_manual.pdf) should be consulted should anyone wish to carry out further work on the game. 

It is intended to extract the listing from the manual and include it in this repository.
